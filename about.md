## Achievements


* [**Ipipeline**](#) 
   
   Within my first year as a professional software developer I was named as a technical lead on a major project for a top tier client. During my time as technical lead for the project I was able to lead the project out of the red and back in to good standing with the client. I gained a reputation for being able to join new teams and help pull their projects back in to good standings quickly. Before my time was complete at the company I held a similar role on two other projects which also were both back on schedule during my time with the team.

* [**Ultimate Software**](#) 

    I interviewed at Ultimate Software for a junior-mid level C# software engineer position. At the time I was only experienced with the C# programming langauge on the Windows operating system utilizing MSSQL. Instead of being hired for a C# position I was hired as on to a team that was using an entire stack outside of my familiarity. The team was using Go, Ruby, Linux, and PSQL. I initially hired as a trial employee on a three month contract with the chance for permanent placement. I proved how quickly I learn and was offered a full time position in less than two months.

    Another achievement I earned was winning the Spring 2017 [48 Hours Hackathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxwVQUAz6hc). My team won the award for Best Technical Tool. The project came about because I noticed a lack of centralized documentation within the company. I know.. I know.. docs are boring but they were spread out all over the place. My team forked a popular gitbooks solution. From there we created a site where a team within the company could come and find all of the documentation sites for each development team. If a team did not have a documentation site yet they could click a button, provide some creds and poof, a new documentations site would be generated in their repository. The kicker was the backend though. Behind the scenes all of the documentation was served on a kubernetes server. Whenever a team updated any of the markdown or any of the files within their documentation site it would kick of our CI, rebuild the image of their docs and push to the registry upstream. K8s would automatically detect the new version of the image and update their docs. This was all unknown to the user. They simply got a new site through our UI then pushed markdown, images etc to their new documentation site repository. All of the CI, containerization, platform and infrastructure was abstracted away and automated so the user did not have to worry about it.
