### [Gostuff](https://github.com/xmattstrongx/gostuff) 
A hectic playground repo that I have used over the years to learn Go. I often check back to repo for examples of things that I have used but are stale in my memory.

### [Visit Tracker API](https://github.com/xmattstrongx/visit-tracker-api)
This base of this project was originally given as a coding test for an interview. I have removed all company information to protect the companies test. I extended the project quite extensively to play around with a few technologies including docker, postgresql, and a rest web api framework for Go.

## Open Source Contributions

### [Go-Kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit)

  This was my first open source contribution. I have read guides that said to get over the fear of failing you should contribute something small like a documentation change or a command line flag etc. I decided to completely ignore that I dive in to Go-kit. Peter Bourgon was extremely helpful and courteous during this process and I will always be thankful for that. 
   
### [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)

   As a Go developer I very much appreciate the problem that is dependency management in Go. The people that maintain this project and work actively with Google to fix the issue contribute a massive amount of time and energy to this. I greatly appreciate that and try to show that appreciation by picking up an issue every now and then.

### [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go)

   Seeing as how I do not currently know Typescript you may be wondering how I contribute to VSCode. I actually do not contribute source code to the IDE but rather participate as a beta test for the Go plugin.
